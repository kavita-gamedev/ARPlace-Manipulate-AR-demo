    m_Localized: 'Users must remain aware of their surroundings while engaged with
      this app. Be cautious about where you are walking and what you are doing in
      the real world as you use your mobile device to view AR imagery juxtaposed
      with the real world.


      The app does NOT depict real or existing underground
      utilities, so it should not be used to determine location of underground utilities
      for excavation. It is entirely a fictitious, procedurally generated depiction
      of content used solely for a gaming/education experience.


      The app depicts
      repair operations that are only minimally and loosely based on real world repair
      techniques. No repair gaming simulations should be interpreted as actual instructions
      as to how to repair an underground utility - any identification of a real world
      damaged utility should involve an individual contacting the owner of the utility
      - and in the case of gas and electric, contacting 911 first!


      This app
      does not collect personally identifying information from users. Further, we
      will never not knowingly collect, use or share information from children under
      age 13 without parental consent or as permitted by law. Any user, or the parent
      or guardian of a user, may contact Virginia 811 about our data privacy and
      security practices using the contact information found in our online privacy
      policy.'
